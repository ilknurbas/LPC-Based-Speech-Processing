# LPC-Based-Speech-Processing

This repository contains materials for a task focusing on time-frequency analysis, linear prediction, and LPC-based signal synthesis. The task includes **calculating the spectrogram, energy, and zero-crossing rate of a speech signal, implementing linear prediction for speech analysis, and synthesizing the signal using LPC coefficients with two types of excitation: the original residual and an impulse train**. The dataset used is a speech sample from the LibriSpeech corpus, and MATLAB is used for all analysis and synthesis tasks. This provides hands-on experience in speech signal processing and synthesis techniques.
